<b> Squidward's Life </b> <h2/>

<p> Squidward childhood was very difficult. He grew up in <i>Biking Bottom</i>, and while in school (which remains unknown) he was rejected by everyone, therefore had no friends.
He sat near the garbage can to eat his lunch at school.<br><br> When older, he started working for Eugene Krabs, in the Krusty Krab. His life was fine until, Spongebob Squarepants came along.
His life became boring and lame with his annoying neighbours, Spongebob and Patrick. 
He is seen as grumpy, easily irritated, selfish, miserable and serious but people miss that he is actually really intelligent.
